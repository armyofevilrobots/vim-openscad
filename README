PATHOGEN - ized vim-openscad ftplugin

This is just a quick and dirty wrap of the openscad vim syntax
highlighting plugin. Thanks to Sirtaj Singh Kang for building
this, and take a look at the original files at:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3556

This is tested as working on vim/ubuntu natty. YMMV. I'll see
about adding indent support so that we get a nice \= in the
future, but no guarantees.
